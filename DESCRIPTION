Description: This is an R adaption of the Up-Down method for minimizing experiment subjects in 50% lethal dose studdies, described by (Brownlee1953). It is developed for Von Frey filament experiments, thus standard steps for these are hardcoded, but with the standard costum sitting it is applicable for all Up-Down-ld50 expreiments. As of version 0.1.0 the code is applied with a commulative likelihood function based on the normal distribution, with exact stepsizes (Brownlee1953) or average stepsizes as described in (Dixon1980), but not limmeted by the 6-9 expermints as found in Table 7.
