Description: This is an R adaption of the Up-Down method for minimizing experiment subjects in 50\% lethal dose studdies, described by (Brownlee1953). As of this version the code is applied with a commulative likelihood function based on the normal distribution, with exact stepsizes (Brownlee1953) or average stepsizes (flexible or constant delta) as described in (Dixon1980), but not limmeted by the 6-9 expermints as found in Table 7.
